# ZhuaTech AI Red Team

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for manufacturing planning, execution, quality, and traceability.

ZhuaTech AI Red Team provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for manufacturing planning, execution, quality, and traceability. It is designed for manufacturing planners, production teams, quality teams, and plant managers, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise ai red team, self-hosted ai red team, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Manufacturing planners, production teams, quality teams, and plant managers.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Campaign Audit** — Manage campaign audit with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Master data and production records** — Coordinate master data and production records through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Planning and execution workflows** — Track planning and execution workflows metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Quality gates and exception handling** — Preserve quality gates and exception handling evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Equipment or process traceability** — Expose equipment or process traceability in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Operational dashboards and alerts** — Connect operational dashboards and alerts to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```


## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- AI-related features must retain human review, provider configuration, traceability, and safe fallback behavior.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
